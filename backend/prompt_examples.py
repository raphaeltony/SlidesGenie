Features of a Monopoly Market 
Some characteristics of a monopoly market are as follows.
The product has only one seller in the market.

Monopolies possess information that is unknown to others in the market.

There are profit maximization and price discrimination associated with monopolistic markets. Monopolists are guided by the need to maximize profit either by expanding sales production or by raising the price.

It has high barriers to entry for any new firm that produces the same product.

The monopolist is the price maker, i.e., it decides the price, which maximizes its profit. The price is determined by evaluating the demand for the product.

The monopolist does not discriminate among customers and charges them all alike for the same product.

Period 2 elements 
Beryllium (Be) has one of the highest melting points of all the light metals. Small amounts of beryllium were synthesised during the Big Bang, although most of it decayed or reacted further within stars to create larger nuclei, like carbon, nitrogen or oxygen. Beryllium is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen.[9] Between 1% and 15% of people are sensitive to beryllium and may develop an inflammatory reaction in their respiratory system and skin, called chronic beryllium disease.[10]
Boron (B) does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. It is an essential plant micronutrient, required for cell wall strength and development, cell division, seed and fruit development, sugar transport and hormone development,[11][12] though high levels are toxic.
Carbon (C) is the fourth-most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium and oxygen[13] and is the second-most abundant element in the human body by mass after oxygen,[14] the third-most abundant by number of atoms.[15] There are an almost infinite number of compounds that contain carbon due to carbon's ability to form long stable chains of C—C bonds.[16][17] All organic compounds, those essential for life, contain at least one atom of carbon;[16][17] combined with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, carbon is the basis of every important biological compound.[17]
Nitrogen (N) is found mainly as mostly inert diatomic gas, N2, which makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume. It is an essential component of proteins and therefore of life.
Oxygen (O) comprising 21% of the atmosphere by volume and is required for respiration by all (or nearly all) animals, as well as being the principal component of water. Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, and oxygen compounds dominate the Earth's crust.
Fluorine (F) is the most reactive element in its non-ionized state, and so is never found that way in nature.
Neon (Ne) is a noble gas used in neon lighting.

What are the Properties of Light?
Following are the important properties of light –

Light travels in a straight line.
The speed of light is faster than sound. Light travels at a speed of 3 x 108 m/s.
Reflection of light
Reflection is the phenomenon in which light travelling in one medium, incident on the surface of another returns to the first medium, obeying the laws of reflection. According to the laws of reflection

The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
Refraction of light
Refraction is a phenomenon in which there is a change in the speed of light as it travels from one medium to another and there is a bending of the ray of light. The refracted ray obeys the following laws.

The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
For the given pair of media and for the light of the given wavelength, the ratio of the sin of the angle of incidence to the sin of the angle of refraction is always a constant.
Dispersion of light
The splitting of a ray of white light into its constituent colours is called dispersion.

Diffraction of light
The phenomenon of bending of light around corners of small obstacles and hence it’s encroachment into the region of the geometrical shadow is called diffraction.

Polarisation of light
Normal light vibrates in all directions perpendicular to the propagation of light. If the light is constrained to vibrate in only one particular plane, then the light is called polarised light. The phenomenon is called polarisation.

Interference of light
Interference is the phenomenon of modification in the intensity of light due to redistribution of light energy in the region of superposition of two or more light waves.

    '''Monopoly market : Imagine a large castle on a hill, surrounded by a moat. The castle represents the market, and the moat symbolizes the barriers that separate it from others.

One seller : Inside the castle, there is a grand throne room where a single ruler sits on a majestic throne. This ruler represents the only seller in the market, commanding absolute control.

Unknown information : In a hidden chamber within the castle, ancient scrolls with secret knowledge are stored. The monopolist has access to these scrolls, giving them an advantage over others who seek the same information.

Profit maximization : Picture a mountain of gold coins piling up outside the castle walls. The higher the stack, the more the monopolist strives to reach its peak by expanding sales production or raising the price.

Price discrimination : On one side of the castle's courtyard, people from all walks of life line up with different colored tickets in hand. A gatekeeper checks each ticket, allowing some privileged individuals to enter at a higher price while others must pay a lower price.

High barriers to entry : At the castle's entrance, there is a massive stone wall embedded with spikes and guarded by fierce dragons. These obstacles represent the difficulties faced by any new firm trying to enter the market.

Price maker : Above the castle gates, a gigantic gavel swings ominously. With every swing, the monopolist decides the price, as its power to dictate market conditions echoes throughout the land.

Demand : Floating in the sky above the castle, a constellation of stars takes the form of customers eagerly reaching out their hands. The brightness of each star represents the level of demand for the monopolist's product.

No discrimination : Inside the castle's grand banquet hall, a long table stretches endlessly, filled with identical plates of food. The monopolist serves all customers equally, giving no distinction or preference to anyone.

Strange Vivid Imagery:

Beryllium (Be): Picture a scorching hot beach (Be) with a massive melting pot on top. Inside the pot, tiny planets (Be) made of metal are melting away, symbolizing its high melting point and its creation during the Big Bang.

Boron (B): Now, let's transition to a tranquil garden where towering bamboo trees (B) sway gently. Their roots represent the essential plant micronutrient and their tall, strong stalks symbolize the cell wall strength and development it provides.

Carbon (C): As we walk through the garden, the bamboo trees suddenly transform into a long chain of carbon atoms (C—C). These carbon atom ropes start forming stable bridges, connecting various compounds (representing the infinite number of carbon-containing compounds) and forming the backbone of life's building blocks.

Nitrogen (N): From the carbon ropes, we ascend into the sky, where we see a vast hot air balloon (N2) floating by, making up a significant portion of the atmosphere. The balloon is made of protein molecules, symbolizing nitrogen's role in essential cellular components.

Oxygen (O): As we continue our journey, we come across a sparkling blue lake, representing the Earth's oceans. The lake is alive with fish and other animals, all of them taking deep breaths (respiration) as they need oxygen to survive.

Fluorine (F): Suddenly, the lake becomes a whirlpool, and everything in it is vigorously spinning. Among the chaos, a vivid green flash emerges, representing fluorine's highly reactive nature and its absence in its non-ionized state.

Neon (Ne): Finally, as we reach the end of our adventure, we find ourselves in a bustling cityscape filled with neon signs (Ne). The city is vibrant and full of energy, just like neon lighting that shines brightly without reacting with other elements.

Now, let's create vivid imagery for each keyword, connecting one image to the next to aid in memorization:

Light: Imagine a bright, glowing light bulb floating in the air.

Straight Line: Now, picture the light bulb's rays forming a perfectly straight line like a laser beam shooting through the air.

Speed of Light: This light beam suddenly transforms into a speedy superhero, zooming through the air at an incredible pace, leaving a trail of light as it moves.

Reflection: The speedy light superhero encounters a shiny mirror, and as it hits the mirror's surface, it sees its own reflection in a dazzling display of light.

Laws of Reflection: Two wise judges appear beside the mirror, holding gavels, representing the laws of reflection. They point their gavels in the same direction as the incident and reflected light rays.

Refraction: Now, the light superhero enters a pool of water, and its path bends as if it's going through a funhouse maze, showcasing the bending of light during refraction.

Laws of Refraction: Inside the water, the light superhero encounters two strict teachers with protractors, representing the laws of refraction. They measure the angles of incidence and refraction, ensuring they remain in the same plane.

Dispersion: Emerging from the water, the light superhero transforms into a wizard, holding a magical prism. The wizard waves the prism, and the white light splits into a beautiful rainbow of colors.

Diffraction: The colorful light rainbow encounters a tiny wizard apprentice with a wand, causing the light to bend around obstacles like magic, creating a mesmerizing diffraction pattern.

Polarisation: The rainbow light transforms into waves, and they start vibrating in all directions. Then, a giant hand comes and restrains the waves, forcing them to move only in one plane, like a flag waving in the wind.

Interference: Finally, two groups of light waves with different colors collide, and a friendly battle between them ensues. They merge and interfere with each other, resulting in regions of bright and dark bands, forming an intriguing interference pattern.
